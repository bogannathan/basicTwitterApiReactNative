# React Native Basic Twitter API

React Native version of [this project](https://github.com/bogannathan/basicTwitterAPI)

Note: I only had an android phone available for the development of this project. If there are any iOS errors, I am sure I could fix them, but I did not have an iOS device available for the development of this project. 

It is paginated the best I think was reasonable could be done. 10 tweets wouldn't fit well on my Samsung S8, so on smaller screens the tweets would be too small to read. So it is a scrollview, but it can scroll to every tenth index, which is very similar to pagination.
